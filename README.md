It uses the pynput library to monitor keyboard events and sends the captured keystrokes to a specified email address using the smtplib library.

#Features

A Gmail account (for sending emails)
#Usage
Install the pynput library by running pip install pynput in your terminal.
Create a new Python file (e.g., keystroke_analyzer.py) and copy the script into it.
Replace "your - email - here" with your Gmail address in the sendEmail function.
